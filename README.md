# test_02_git_repro
A test repro where I can learn git.
I set this up on Sat Jan 5, 2019. 

I played around with creating a repro on my desktop. For this repor, I created it in GitHub first then I cloned it on the Git bash shell on my desktop. Seems a little easier this way. Generally speaking I'll be suing other people's repros and so will clone them.
